80 - 20 rule

Doing work up front, thinking ahead - see my evernote article

- image in email

- always consider what risks there are 
- try and mitigate the biggest risks first for the least effort (ie..e value)

Turning one risk into another.

e.g. planning mitigates one thing , gives you something else.


Sign offs mitigate communication risk - back to protocols and interpretation again.

Good-fast-cheap triangle


risks beget other risks
