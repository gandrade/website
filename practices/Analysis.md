## Critical Chain

So managing **Schedule Risk** due to **Student Syndrome** is very important.  [Goldratt's Critical Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_chain_project_management) addresses exactly this concern.   Briefly, the idea of this is:

### 1. Identify the system constraint

2. Exploit the system constraint.

3. Subordinate everything else to the system constraint.

4. Elevate the system constraint, and

5. If, in the previous step, a new constraint has been uncovered, repeat the process. Do not let inertia become the system constraint.
